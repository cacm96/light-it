# Patients challenge for Light-it


This repo contains code base for Light-It frontend developer challenge.

## Explanation

This repo was build using the next listed technologies:
- CSS from scratch, in order to show my CSS skills. Such as organization (with Grid), smooth animations, creation of reusable components, creation of a Modal components from scratch and Toast component from scratch for notifications.
- Grid to organized the displayed elements efficiently.
- React Query to manage data fetching due to its simplified remote data management, optimized caching and handling loading, error, and success states.
- Axios to handling API requests because is a old goodie library and has a big community.
- React Hook Form for form validations because has a great documentation and is a well-known library that I worked before.
- Zustand for global state management because is a lighter library, easy to use and it's my favorite.
